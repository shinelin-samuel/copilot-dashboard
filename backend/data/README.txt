### Database Description
The Sakila sample database is a fictitious database designed to represent a DVD rental store. The tables of the database include film, film_category, actor, customer, rental, payment and inventory among others.
The Sakila sample database is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth.
Detailed information about the database can be found on the MySQL website: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/

Sakila for SQLite is a part of the sakila-sample-database-ports project intended to provide ported versions of the original MySQL database for other database systems, including:

Oracle
SQL Server
SQLIte
Interbase/Firebird
Microsoft Access

Sakila for SQLite is a port of the Sakila example database available for MySQL, which was originally developed by Mike Hillyer of the MySQL AB documentation team.
This project is designed to help database administrators to decide which database to use for development of new products
The user can run the same SQL against different kind of databases and compare the performance

### Files Description
The `sqlite-sakila-db` folder contains SQL scripts used to generate the Sakila schema and data for SQLite. If you want to import the Sakila data into PostgreSQL for local development, you'll need to adapt these scripts for Postgres (types and certain pragmas) or use a Postgres-compatible dump.

For convenience, you can also load sample data into a running Postgres instance using your preferred import tools or by running migration scripts that target PostgreSQL.
